Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure to have Python3_ or later installed
* Tests require the Tkinter_ toolkit for Python. Python3+ should include Tkinter, but if not check the link provided for install instructions
* If using the Qt interfaces, the proper PyQt_ version must be installed for Python 3+.  This can be accomplished using your Linux/Unix package manager, Anaconda, or pip (except PyQt4).
* The games can be started by runing the following on a command line (windows):

.. code:: bash

   py simpleclicker.py

* For Linux/Unix:   

.. code:: bash
   
   $ python3 simpleclicker.py
